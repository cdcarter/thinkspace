How in Lightning orgs should admins do data management? You have to save a report before you can run it so one off reports aren't as easy, list views can't be created for objects without tabs,  bulk edit in list views still not delivered. what's the suggestion for *dealing with your bad data*?

Some suggestions:
* Dataloader(.io)
* Workbench
* Demandtools
* [Learn Python w/ this great tutorial](http://oracle2salesforce.blogspot.com/2016/08/python-for-salesforce-administrators.html)!
